title: I've started a blog!
---

I've been meaning to do this for some time, but have only just had the opportunity to devote myself to the task (thanks to COVID-19 enabling me to ignore what I'm actually meant to be doing). So here is my blog, inventively named after me, [wobrotson](http://wobrotson.github.io). 

The subject matter of this blog will vary depending on what I've been doing, but I imagine it will mostly relate to my research and my adventures, which both relate mostly to [karst](https://www.gsi.ie/en-ie/programmes-and-projects/groundwater/activities/understanding-irish-karst/Pages/What-is-karst.aspx). I will also cover any useful computer-related information I stumble upon as I try and get better at geospatial computing.

I'm going to sign off for now and begin to write a blogpost with some interesting content, but I thought it would be useful to introduce things in some way. If you want any more information, then head over to the [about](https://wobrotson.github.io/about/) page. Here is a nice picture of a sunrise to mark the dawning of my new era of blogging and (hopefully) technological mastery. Enjoy!
