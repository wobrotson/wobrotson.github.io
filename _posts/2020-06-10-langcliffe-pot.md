title:  'Trans-dales caving, dreams of anothernother Pooh part 2'
---

If I had to sum up in one word what drives and inspires me most in my short, overall insignificant blip of existence, it would be "the unknown". I love learning and discovering probably above all else. However, as Newton (and actually, as I discovered, [Archimedes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593)) discovered, there are limits. There are some things I would rather not contemplate. "Can the universe even be called big if it is infinite?" I am scared shitless by thoughts like this, probably because my brain starts melting thinking of the journey through the mantle to the Earth's molten interior. The philosophical implications of anything so unquestionably limitless are intangible to me. My lack of ability to ponder such abstractions was probably why I spent much more of my undergraduate degree going caving than going to lectures about solid earth geophysics. It was during one of these days, when I should have been taking notes on the Post-Perovskite Phase Transition at the D-double prime region or Large Low-Shear Velocity Provinces, that my friend George and I first paid a visit to Langcliffe Pot. 

Penyghent and Fountains Fell have been the scene of many of my fondest memories from Dales caving. The summit of Penyghent in particular has fantastic character and it's topography really captivates me. Its fantastic position, bridging the more desolate and wild lands of Wharfedale and Littondale to the east with the rather more civilised and tamed fells to the west that are home to most of the better-known caves in the Yorkshire Dales, lends it a certain stateliness and regality, like a sphinx guarding entry to the elusive network of caverns that must exist below. I've visited Penyghent Pot almost 10 times and I still really feel like I've barely got to know the place, having only ventured into the Extensions once and never to the Living Dead passages. the mystery of the Hunt Pot Inlet ceasing to flow in the 1980s Two groups of cavers are broadly responsible for the most recent discoveries: the 'Thursday Night Team' from the Northern Pennine Club, and the ULSA cavers of the late 1980s. Their commitment and passion for pushing nasty little shitholes, in the hope they would eventually find some passage that they could perhaps stand up in, was quite incredible.

Penyghent Gill is an odd place but has a lot of character, bearing the hallmarks of late fluvial incision rather than glacial erosion as can be seen in its neighbouring dales, Ribblesdale and Littondale. Often in these types of cave, you get strange little hints of something grander before an unexpected end, [Swan Dike Pot](https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php?topic=21246.0) being a good example. 

However, I 

"A trip to the far reaches is one of the most serious undertakings in British Caving."

"One of Yorkshire's truly great caving expeditions."

Even the name of the promised prize, 'Black Keld Master Cave', seems to evoke untapped possibilities of another world below, like a Jules Verne novel but within the realms of geological possibility. 

It was a sunny afternoon and the valley of Wharfedale was dappled in golden rays. This took some of the edge off the sense of foreboding. Wharfedale is a truly special place, at once inspiring and beautiful but also clearly of a higher power that holds no emotional attachment to the wills of those who seek pleasure in its surroundings. I think that this feeling is definitely enhanced by the tragic events of the past, but the way that Kilnsey crag looms over the western side of the valley appears to me like the mouth of some great beast, of which the mountain is a part, waiting to swallow me up at the slightest false step.

The top of Langcliffe Moor is one of the few places in the Dales where one feels truly remote: no buildings or are visible from the cave entrance, and there is no sound of traffic. With the whole fell to yourself, it is pleasantly easy to forget that you arrived here in a car on a road after leaving your house in the city. All of that, the clutter, the grey, the planning and precision makes way for fragments from times long past.
