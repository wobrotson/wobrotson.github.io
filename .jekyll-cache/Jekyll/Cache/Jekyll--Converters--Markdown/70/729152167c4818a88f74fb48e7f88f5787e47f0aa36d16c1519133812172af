I"ç<p>If I had to sum up what drives and inspires me most in my short, overall insignificant blip of existence, it would be ‚Äúthe unknown‚Äù. I love learning and discovering probably above all else. There are some things I would rather not know, like how ridiculously big the universe is. Some people seem to find comfort in knowing how enormous everything is outside of us. I am scared shitless by it, probably because my brain starts melting thinking of the journey to the Earth‚Äôs molten interior, let alone the unfathomable temperatures of some star whose light can‚Äôt reach my eyes because its so far away. I like to visualise. My lack of empathy with Earth‚Äôs core was probably why I spent much more of my undergraduate degree caving than going to lectures about whatever clever ideas Sebastian Rost or Stephen Stackhouse had developed recently.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve written plenty of caving trip reports over the years, many of which you can find on the website of my caving club, <a href="https://ulsa.org.uk/">ULSA</a>, or on <a href="https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php">UKCaving</a>. These usually try and capture the essence of a certain day of caving,</p>
