I"≥<p>If I had to sum up in one word what drives and inspires me most in my short, overall insignificant blip of existence, it would be ‚Äúthe unknown‚Äù. I love learning and discovering probably above all else. However, as Newton (and actually, as I discovered, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593">Archimedes</a>) discovered, there are limits. There are some things I would rather not know, like how ridiculously big the universe is. Can the universe even be called big if it is infinite? I am scared shitless by thoughts like this, probably because my brain starts melting thinking of the journey through the mantle to the Earth‚Äôs molten interior. The philosophical implications of anything so unquestionably limitless are intangible to me. My lack of ability to ponder such abstractions was probably why I spent much more of my undergraduate degree going caving than going to lectures about solid earth geophysics. It was during one of these days, when I should have been taking notes on the Post-Perovskite Phase Transition at the D-double prime region or Large Low-Shear Velocity Provinces, that my friend George and I first paid a visit to Langcliffe Pot.</p>
