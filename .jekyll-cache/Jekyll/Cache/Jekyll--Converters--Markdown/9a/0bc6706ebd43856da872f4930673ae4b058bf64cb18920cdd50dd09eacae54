I")<p>If I had to sum up in one word what drives and inspires me most in my short, overall insignificant blip of existence, it would be “the unknown”. I love learning and discovering probably above all else. However, as Newton (and actually, as I discovered, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593">Archimedes</a>) discovered, there are limits. There are some things I would rather not know, like how ridiculously big the universe is. Some people seem to find comfort in knowing how enormous everything is outside of us. I am scared shitless by this knowledge, probably because my brain starts melting thinking of the journey through the mantle to the Earth’s molten interior. The unfathomable temperatures and pressures within some star whose light barely reaches us certainly don’t enter my scope of “unknown”. My lack of empathy with Earth’s core was probably why I spent much more of my undergraduate degree going caving than going to lectures about solid earth geophysics. It was during one of these days when I should have been taking notes on the Post-Perovskite Phase Transition at the D-double prime region or Large Low-Shear Velocity Provinces that my friend George and I first paid a visit to Langcliffe Pot.</p>

<p>I’ve written plenty of caving trip reports over the years, many of which you can find on the website of my caving club, <a href="https://ulsa.org.uk/">ULSA</a>, or on <a href="https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php">UKCaving</a>. These usually try and capture the essence of a certain day of caving,</p>
