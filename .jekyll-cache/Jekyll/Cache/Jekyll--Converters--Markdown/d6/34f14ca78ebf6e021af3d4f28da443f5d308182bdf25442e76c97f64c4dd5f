I"‡<p>It all started, as is often the case, at a party. The party in question was the annual CHECC forum/piss-up in late November, which is always one of my favourite weekends of the year and generally a time when I like to let go. During the height of Friday nightâ€™s antics, a brief lull saw a few of us assembled outside considering our next moves. We all commented that K Brook wasnâ€™t here, and that if he had been he would certainly be performing splendidly by now.</p>

<p>â€˜He never does anything fun these days does he?â€™, said Emmott begrudgingly. â€˜He was meant to be running this race with me in January but he hasnâ€™t committed.â€™ (It must be pointed out that such commitment cannot be expected from K Brook in any case).</p>

<p>â€˜Rob, do you want to run a race with me?â€™</p>

<p>â€˜Whatâ€™s this race exactly?â€™</p>

<p>â€˜You run for 8 hours through the night at the end of January on the fells in North Wales.â€™</p>

<p>Emmott Baddeley is a very good friend of mine who I had been to a lot of parties with and been with on some great caving trips since we met. Despite having had a lot of fun (or perhaps because of it), weâ€™d never really suffered in one anotherâ€™s company before (maybe apart from when Emmott got stuck in Large Pot entrance, for which I take full responsibility). I was not a <em>runner</em> by any stretch of the imagination: I didnâ€™t have the shoes, I didnâ€™t look the part and I didnâ€™t live in Sheffield. This sounded like a different level of discomfort with which I was not familiar.</p>

<p>But it was CHECC, I was having a great time and anyway, Lydia and Olly were doing it too apparently and they werenâ€™t runners either. I like new challenges. Anything felt possible.</p>

<p>â€˜Fuck yeah, why not? Dark, cold, miserableâ€¦ basically caving anyway, right!?â€™</p>

<p>And thus the merriment continued and I proceeded to forget all about the foolish engagement to which I had committed.</p>

<p>Sunday morning came around, after a long Saturday night of raving and the trees and the lights being wavier than usual. I was somewhat the worse for wear. Emmott came up to me having just finished helping with breakfast.</p>

<p>â€˜Rob, Olly and Lydia have just come back from a run.â€™</p>

<p>Run. Iâ€™m meant to be doing that now. Shit. Lydia had also been helping with breakfast. In my fragile mental state, this knowledge provoked extremely troubling thoughts. How had Lydia and Olly got ahead of the game so quickly? Why hadnâ€™t I gone for a run yet? Were the trees still waving at me? I started to help clean up to take my mind off it all.</p>

<p>We had two months to get ready. During this time I also had to start a new job in Ireland and Emmott had to negotiate a reduction in workload from their boss. So not a stress-free time for either of us. I also had to get some suitable shoes. Luckily, my friend Hannah Moulton, who is really good at running, sorted me out with some decent ones. Inov8 Mudclaws. As the name suggests, they are designed for negotiating muddy terrain.</p>

<p>We decided that we would go for a â€˜testing the waterâ€™ run around the High Peak in a weeks time just to check we were all up for it before committing the whopping Â£75 to enter. (Yes, this is a lot of money that I would never usually dream of paying just to run all night, something you could do without paying to be in the race, but apparently it was the last year of the event so might as well do it once). At the pub, I started telling people I was doing a race. Among them was Alex Burton-Johnson aka BJ, a man with a notorious laugh and a lot of entertaining stories about falling asleep inappropriately. Also a field geologist for the British Antarctic Survey who has done a lot of polar trips, BJ knows a bit about being cold.</p>

<p>â€˜So, youâ€™re doing Dark Mountains are you?â€™ (Dark Mountains was the name of the race).</p>

<p>â€˜Hopefully yeah. Never really done running before so weâ€™ll see how it goes.â€™</p>

<p>â€˜Well, youâ€™ve picked a good place to start.â€™</p>

<p>â€˜Youâ€™ve done it then?â€™</p>

<p>â€˜Yeah, did it with Holmes. Got hypothermic, had to sit in the group shelter for a while till I stopped shivering. Youâ€™ll be fine though, head down and power through.â€™</p>

<p>Imagining myself attempting to run in temperatures that got BJ hypothermic struck me with a sizeable fork of fear. This man had reportedly walked up a hill in the Lakes in a blizzard wearing his interview suit (cavers, or at least the ones I know, only wear suits to interviews) while everyone else was wearing winter gear. (In a show of sympathy, his companions had proceeded to throw an egg at him at the top before descending). And as for Holmes, if you imagine a shepherd from a remote corner of the Karakoram who is able to mistake parafin for gin and still speak after consuming a large volume of it then youâ€™ll have an idea of the kind of characters who found this race a challenge. Stupidity and resilience in equal measure.</p>

<p>To say I was not filled with confidence would be an understatement, and Iâ€™m not known for a lack of confidence.</p>

<p>After a pleasant evening trip down Nettle Pot with Olly, Leo and Harlow the night before, I set out for the TSG with Olly from Sheffield. I had a feeling of nagging trepidation, accompanied by the irrepressible excitement I always have for days spent in the outdoors. It was a beautiful morning: the air was crisp and the sky showed signs of staying blue, although the sun was threatening to hide behind descending cloud the closer we got to Castleton. The fell had been absolutely baltic when we emerged sodden from Nettle the night before and this memory certainly added to my</p>
