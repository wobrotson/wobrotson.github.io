I"Q8<p>It all started, as is often the case, at a party. The party in question was the annual CHECC forum/piss-up in late November, which is always one of my favourite weekends of the year and generally a time when I like to let go. During the height of Friday night’s antics, a brief lull saw a few of us assembled outside considering our next moves. We all commented that K Brook wasn’t here, and that if he had been he would certainly have been performing splendidly by now.</p>

<p>‘He never does anything fun these days does he?’, said Emmott begrudgingly. ‘He was meant to be running this race with me in January but he hasn’t committed.’ <em>(It must be pointed out that such commitment cannot be expected from K Brook in any case).</em></p>

<p>‘Rob, do you want to run a race with me?’</p>

<p>‘What’s this race exactly?’</p>

<p>‘You run for 8 hours through the night at the end of January on the fells in North Wales.’</p>

<p>Emmott Baddeley is a very good friend of mine who I had been to a lot of parties with and been with on some great caving trips since we met. Despite having had a lot of fun (or perhaps because of it), we’d never really suffered in one another’s company before (apart from when Emmott got stuck in Large Pot entrance, for which I take full responsibility). I was not a <em>runner</em> by any stretch of the imagination: I didn’t have the shoes, I didn’t look the part and I didn’t live in Sheffield. This sounded like a different level of discomfort with which I was not familiar.</p>

<p>But it was CHECC, I was having a great time and anyway, Lydia and Olly were doing it too apparently and they weren’t runners either. I like new challenges. Anything felt possible.</p>

<p>‘Fuck yeah, why not? Dark, cold, miserable… basically caving anyway, right!?’</p>

<p>And thus the merriment continued and I proceeded to forget all about the foolish engagement to which I had committed.</p>

<p>Sunday morning came around, after a long Saturday night of raving and the trees and lights being wavier than usual. I was somewhat the worse for wear. Emmott came up to me having just finished helping with breakfast.</p>

<p>‘Rob, Olly and Lydia have just come back from a run.’</p>

<p>Run. I’m meant to be doing that now. Shit. Lydia had also been helping with breakfast, which meant she had been awake since I went to bed at half 5. In my fragile mental state, this knowledge provoked extremely troubling thoughts. How had Lydia and Olly got ahead of the game so quickly? Why hadn’t I gone for a run yet? Were the trees still waving at me? I started to help clean up to take my mind off it all.</p>

    <i>KBrook: the man who started it all.</i></p>

<hr color="lightgray" />

<p>We had two months to get ready. I had to get some suitable shoes. Luckily, my friend H, who is really good at running, sorted me out with some decent ones. Inov8 Mudclaws. As the name suggests, they are designed for negotiating muddy terrain.</p>

<p>We decided that we would go for a ‘testing the water’ jog around the High Peak in a weeks time just to check we were all up for it before coughing up the whopping £75 to enter. (Yes, this is a lot of money that I would never usually dream of paying just to run all night, but apparently it was the last year of the event so might as well do it once). At the pub, I started telling people I was doing a race. Among them was Alex Burton-Johnson aka BJ, a man with a notorious laugh and a lot of entertaining stories about falling asleep at inappropriate times. Also a field geologist for the British Antarctic Survey who has done a lot of polar trips, BJ knows a bit about being cold.</p>

<p>‘So, you’re doing Dark Mountains are you?’ (Dark Mountains was the name of the race).</p>

<p>‘Hopefully yeah. Never really done running before so we’ll see how it goes.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’ve picked a good place to start.’</p>

<p>‘You’ve done it then?’</p>

<p>‘Yeah, did it with Holmes. Got hypothermic, had to sit in the group shelter for a while till I stopped shivering. You’ll be fine though, head down and power through.’</p>

<p>Imagining myself attempting to run in temperatures that got BJ hypothermic struck me with a sizeable fork of fear. This man had reportedly walked up a hill in the Lakes in a blizzard wearing his interview suit (cavers, or at least the ones I know, only wear suits to interviews) while everyone else was wearing winter gear. (In a show of sympathy, his companions had proceeded to throw an egg at him at the top before descending). And as for Holmes, if you imagine a shepherd from a remote corner of the Karakoram who is able to mistake parafin for gin and still speak after a large swig then you’ll have an idea of the kind of characters who previously found this race a challenge. Stupidity and resilience in equal measure.</p>

<p>To say I was not filled with confidence would be an understatement, and I’m not known for a lack of confidence.</p>

<p>After some cragging at Stanage followed by a pleasant evening trip down Nettle Pot with Olly, Leo and Harlow the day before, I set out for the TSG with Olly from Sheffield. I had a feeling of nagging trepidation, accompanied by the irrepressible excitement I always have for days spent in the outdoors. It was a beautiful morning: the air was crisp and the sky showed signs of staying blue, although the sun was threatening to hide behind descending cloud the closer we got to Castleton. The fell had been absolutely baltic when we emerged sodden from Nettle the night before and this memory certainly added to my unease at the thought of running in what would probably be much more hostile conditions.</p>

<p>We set off after inevitable faff at the TSG, and made our way up towards Hollins Cross after Lydia somehow got us stranded on the wrong side of some barbed wire fences. After this, we headed down into Edale, after which, due to the earlier faff, we found ourselves low on time before Lydia had to be back in Castleton for work, so forewent the ascent of Kinder and headed back up to Lose Hill, then down into Hope and along the river valley to Castleton, where I learnt how to stretch after running, a very important skill. Extremely pleasantly surprised to find that my ankles, which had been worrying me after proving to be quite weak in the past on descents, held up excellently in the new shoes; no pain at all. Turns out that having good grip is quite important.</p>

<p>After demolishing some top pastries from Peveril Stores, we returned to Sheffield. It was the last day to get the ‘early bird’ entry price.</p>

<p>‘So, we gonna do it then?’, said Olly.</p>

<p>A brief silence.</p>

<p>‘Guess we have to really’, replied Emmott, not sounding especially sure.</p>

<p>But five minutes later we had all received emails. ‘Marmot Dark Mountains - entry confirmation.’</p>

<p>Committed.</p>

<hr color="lightgray" />

<p>Over the next month, I did a few pretty minging caving trips. Bye George Pot and the Misty Mountain Series round trip in Easegill was among these, and was far shitter than anticipated (Lydia was turned back after nearly losing a nipple!), but at least George seemed to suffer more than me. These excursions allowed me to remember what being cold was like (important mental preparation for running on Welsh mountains on dark January nights). Olly, Emmott, Lydia and I even did some running together again, and it felt like we were getting faster and fitter despite the infrequency and other life distractions we each had. A particularly memorable event was on New Years Day when we ran up Calf Top from Bullpot Farm after boozing until 5am; my bowels were extremely unhappy after the steep incline and ensuing descent back down to Barbondale, and I had proceeded to empty myself under cover of a bridge, but the frosty morning views of the Lakes, Howgills and Morecambe Bay had more than made up for this. As race day approached, we discussed our preparedness.</p>

<p>The infrequent jaunts we had been doing and the runs I’d done with Ian Peachey had convinced me that the running side of things would not be a problem. For me, the hours adding up seems to make little difference to me physically or mentally; in the words of Javed Bhatti, ‘it’s all about managing the mental landscape’, ie being happy with being miserable for a bit (or for a long time <a href="https://www.ukhillwalking.com/articles/features/javed_bhattis_winter_pennine_way_double-8161">in the case of Javed</a>). I was confident that Emmott would also be able to maintain psyche when 4am and shivering came around; happy days.</p>

<p>The real uncertainties from my perspective were the weather, what gear we had to carry, and food. No point worrying about the weather: it would either be good or it wouldn’t. Navigation in poor weather was not one of my strengths (no GPS devices allowed), but Emmott seemed to know what to do so my responsibilities for this were mostly discharged.</p>

<p>The Dark Mountains Marathon was part of a series of Mountain Marathons in the UK, which meant to qualify to race you had to carry certain required kit. The list was exhastive: obligatory gear included a personal survival bag, group shelter, sleeping mat, sleeping bag <em>and</em> tent. Rather overkill for a race where you were hoping not to be sleeping at all. And you needed these things to be as light as possible, meaning they would be expensive. However, this is what friends are for. Particularly friends like K Brook and Nathan Walker who have obsessions with gear and work/have worked in outdoor shops. I’m quite good at rucksack tetris, and easily convinced myself I could fit everything in with room to spare for food and water.</p>

<p>This was my main concern. I usually don’t eat in caves, and if I do I rely on some sugary rubbish like flapjack to get me out and then have a proper meal (usually consisting of vegetables and lentils, which I much prefer to chocolate). However, I found that not only did I need fuel after only a couple of hours running, but my stomach was left feeling very unsettled and uncomfortable (see New Years Day), a feeling I had never had before from doing other endurance things like cycling. Having the right food could be critical to preventing a complete bonking. After seeing a lot of internet talk about calorie calculations and other nonsense, I was relieved when H (who would be running the elite category at the event) told me that her and her partner Chris ate ‘proper food’ (potatoes, cheese wraps, nuts, boiled eggs) when they were running. ‘Eat stuff you want to eat that can sustain you but isn’t too heavy.’ Sounded good to me: we had a plan.</p>

<p>I had started a new job in Dublin in January, so the logistics of ensuring all my gear arrived at the race had to be placed in other people’s hands. I kept my new shoes though. A run in the Wicklow mountains with my friend Neil, his mate Rhys and Fresh the dog a week prior to the race put my mind totally at ease and the crisp morning views from the top of Djouce were a complete joy. The day after a dawn ascent of Lugnaquilla, the highest hill in Wicklow, capped off an excellent weekend.</p>

<i>Beautiful sunrise over Lug with Hugh and Emily. Hugh's 8th attempt at summiting in good vis, and my second after a wet and windy day out with my Dad in December 2018.</i></p>

<p>Race day came; up at 6am to cycle to the ferry port. Emmott had kindly agreed to pick me up from Bangor train station at lunch time. The forecast had not been great, but was improving. After a shop stop to stock up on a few final things, we headed down the coast to a little-known spot that my family has been visiting since my mum was a kid. It was great to walk up the Roman Steps at Cwm Bychan and feel the wind on my face once we had reached the col. The weather was overcast but very calm considering the forecast and all the apprehensive feelings I had about the race were now suppressed. What was the route going to be? Would we get very lost? Would we find any of the checkpoints? None of it seemed to matter and we were both in a state of tranquility as we packed up for the last time and drove off over the hills and far away. The knowledge that Emmott had packed the best trail mix ever, with chocolate coated almonds and brazil nuts, lumps of fudge and stem ginger, all the seeds and copious dried apricots, pineapple and banana, was making me positively relish the thought of 3am!</p>

<p>After arriving in Bala we stopped for chips. The portion size was substantial. I enjoyed listening to people speaking Welsh and noticed a lot of middle-aged skinny men and women milling around wearing Salomon trainers.</p>
