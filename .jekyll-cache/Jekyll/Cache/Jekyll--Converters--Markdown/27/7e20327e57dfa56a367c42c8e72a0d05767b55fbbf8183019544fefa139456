I"“<p>The Yorkshire Dales has always held a very special place in my mind since my first visits cycle touring with my family as a young boy, and memories of those visits, along with promises of caverns measureless, played a large part in my decision to study close by in Leeds for university. Since then, I have spent a lot of time roaming above and beneath those hills, and I can vividly remember many things about these times that I donâ€™t remember at all about other places. The relief at the smell of the fresh earth, wet and full of life, that overwhelms you during the last few metres of cave passage before exiting to the surface; the merciless, drenching power of water plunging down as if forever; the cut of strong westerlies and the bite of the frozen water on your face as you struggle over featureless surfaces towards new prospects below; time well spent with great friends from many walks of life.</p>
