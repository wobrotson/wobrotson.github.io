I"'<p>Volcanoes and caves have more in common than you might think. Yes, one of them kicks out lots of deadly hot gases and chunks of rock generating a lot of stress if you happen to be in the vicinity, while the other can provide excellent hangover relief when you’re wallowing and splashing your way through a cooling underground streamway (I definitely wouldn’t want to be hungover in the midst of a volcanic eruption). But both systems are controlled by underground plumbing and drainage that is hard to accurately visualise, because both involve anisotropic (directionally variable) ground conditions that are very challenging to study and mostly impossible to access (the cave passages explored by humans are a very small proportion of the flowpaths taken by underground water in karst systems).</p>
