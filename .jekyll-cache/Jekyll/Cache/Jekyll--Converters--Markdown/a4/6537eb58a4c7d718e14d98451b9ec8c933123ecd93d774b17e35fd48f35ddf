I"Û<p>It all started, as is often the case, at a party. The party in question was the annual CHECC forum/piss-up in late November, which is always one of my favourite weekends of the year and generally a time when I like to let go. During the height of Friday nightâ€™s antics, a brief lull saw a few of us assembled outside considering our next moves. We all commented that K Brook wasnâ€™t here, and that if he had been he would certainly be performing splendidly by now.</p>
