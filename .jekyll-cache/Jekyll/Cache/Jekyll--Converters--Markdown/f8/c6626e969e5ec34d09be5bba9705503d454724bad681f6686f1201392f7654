I"$<p>The Yorkshire Dales has always held a very special place in my mind since my first visits cycle touring with my family as a young boy, and memories of those visits, along with promises of caverns measureless, played a large part in my decision to study close by in Leeds for university. Since then, I have spent a lot of time roaming above and beneath those hills, and I can vividly remember many things about these times that I don’t remember at all about other places. The relief at the smell of the fresh earth, wet and full of life, that overwhelms you during the last few metres of cave passage before exiting to the surface; the merciless, drenching power of water plunging down as if forever; the cut of strong westerlies and the bite of the frozen water on your face as you struggle over featureless surfaces towards new prospects below; time well spent with great friends from many walks of life.</p>

<p>Early in my first year of university caving, I borrowed a great book from Ian Peachey, called ‘Adventures of Another Pooh’. The book is a collection of tales by a fellow Leeds University caver from the 70s, Dave Yeandle, about his formative years caving with ULSA in the Dales and beyond. The spirit of this book really captured my imagination and his reasons for coming to Leeds for university were quite similar to my own. On arriving in Leeds, Pooh instantly becomes very much involved with active exploration in the Dales with ULSA, who had made discovery after discovery in the time since 1966 (more on that later). Pooh gets into a lot of rather ridiculous scenarios largely of his own making.</p>

<p>I’ve been fortunate to have explored many of the cave systems etched out within the Great Scar Limestone. From Easegill in the west to Goyden of Nidderdale just west of Harrogate, they all have their individual merits and quirks.</p>

<p>Easegill is the playground of the Dales, with always a new place to visit and familiar passages to re-examine as you might re-read a well-loved book, and a great community of caving surrounding it at Bull Pot Farm. It remains my favourite place to introduce people to caving. <a href="https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php?topic=22640.0">County Pot</a> and the <a href="https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php?topic=24776.0">Easegill Upper Traverse</a> offer very accessible adventure and discovery are to be had here by anyone curious enough to pass through. The more testing southern section of Easegill in Pippikin Pot gives a hint of what the majority of caves in the eastern Yorkshire Dales are like (wet, a bit knarly), but on the whole the caves of the Three Counties system are true gems. There is something to do whatever the weather, and much remains to be understood about the origins and speleogenesis of these caves and likely many major discoveries still to be made.</p>

<p><em>An excellent video of caving in Pippikin Pot filmed only a few years after it had been discovered in 1970. The blasting of Mistral Hole provides easier access now; in those days an involved rescue was thought to be impossible.</em></p>

<p>Then comes Kingsdale, truly a monarch of Yorkshire, with testpieces like <a href="https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php?topic=21583.0">Broken Finger Pot</a> a stone’s throw from historical landmarks like Philosophers Crawl (where the breakthrough to the Kingsdale Master Cave was made) and Master Cave downstream sump (dived to Keld Head in 1979, a feat dubbed the ‘Underground Eiger’ - see the film of the same name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbkA8KA81SM">here</a>). This wealth of inspiring underground adventures is largely testament to the incredible perseverance (and fortune) of the jammiest bastards in cavings history, the Brook Brothers. I’ve had my share of ‘epics’ and misadventures here too: memories of silly, hungover thrashing through the <a href="https://ukcaving.com/board/index.php?topic=21964.0">Rowten sumps</a> with a failing light and a long night early on in my Dales caving career spent shivering in King Pot spring to mind. I’d still like to attempt the ‘Kingsdale Pull-through Marathon’ of doing Swinsto, Simpsons, Rowten, Heron and King Pots all in one day, although the time I conceived of this idea was just before I got stuck in Lost John’s after pulling through down Monastery instead of Centipede: perhaps some kind of subliminal attempt at dissuasion…</p>

<p>I’m going to skip over Ingleborough, arguably the most well-known fell in the Dales and home to the best-known cave in Yorkshire, Gaping Gill. Although I’ve done some good trips here it really doesn’t appeal to me in the same way as the caves either side of it, though Hensler’s Master Cave and Far Country are good fun to run around in. There are some interesting gaps in the trans-dales cave knowledge here, for example at Newvby Moss Pot. I’ve visited this twice, and it looks promising,</p>
