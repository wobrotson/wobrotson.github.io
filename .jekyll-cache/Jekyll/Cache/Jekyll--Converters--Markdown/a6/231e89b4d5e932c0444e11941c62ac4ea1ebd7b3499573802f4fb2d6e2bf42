I"<p>In 1907, the first synthetic plastic, <em>Bakelite</em>, was produced. That same year, Otto Krummel published what might be the first stand-alone map of the Marianas Trench, the deepest point on Earth’s surface. When plastic started to be produced on industrial scales in the 1950s, the first ascent of Everest was made. A decade later on January 23rd 1960, Jacques Picard and Don Walsh made a <a href="http://www.deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/1960-dive/">historic first visit</a> to the black depths of Marianas. In that decade, global plastic production had reached 47 million tonnes in total (8 million in the year 1960). Over 60 years have now passed since then, and the ocean waters into which Picard and Walsh descended have been unquestionably altered by the now nearly 8 billion tonnes of plastic that preside on our planet today.</p>

<p>Pervasive pollution is an overwhelming consequence of the technological advances humanity has made since the Industrial Revolution. Nuclear waste, building materials such as concrete and aluminium, and plastics are now mixed in with sediments across the globe which in time will turn into rocks. The preservation of temporal markers in the rock record (and other planetary archives such as cave stalagmites or polar ice cores) informs our knowledge of Earth’s history, and a group of geologists called the ‘Anthropocene Working Group’ was set up in 2009 to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/anthropocene-holocene-geology-drama/565628/">investigate</a> whether we as a species might be responsible for changes so vast that they represent a new epoch in Earth Time.</p>

<p>Even to non-rock botherers, however, the degree to which plastics are present in the environment is very clear. We don’t need to read reports of ‘ocean garbage patches the size of Wales’ or whatever - I bet every single inhabitant of the UK has seen many bits of plastic every day when out for their ‘daily exercise’. It’s also no secret among the general public that the fate of plastic products is not as they thought only 10 years or so ago. Contrary to what I was taught in school growing up, I now know plastic can’t be recycled efficiently at all: indeed, only around 20% of plastics are recycled today, with the rest being incinerated (releasing greenhouse gases and polluting aerosols, nasty stuff) or floating around us in the atmosphere, biosphere and deep ocean like a smog of judgment.</p>

<p>Microplastics, those plastics that are smaller than 5 mm in size, are a source of heightened concern environmentally due to their ability to be ingested by creatures of any size.  We know plastic is in rainwater, it’s in the deep ocean, it’s on the beach… it’s everywhere. The thought of this great shame, brought about in the 20th century, lingering and smothering future generations is not one most people are happy to countenance, so understandably they want to do something about it.</p>

<p>The exact fate of all our plastic waste is still far from well-constrained, however, despite the phenomenal amount of study occurring in this field. For example, <em>some unknown quantity of microplastic research</em>.</p>

<p>One of the environments which we know least about on Earth is, without question, the cave environment. An unknowable amount of passage still remains unmapped, it’s inhabitants and natural wonders unseen. Cavers are generally extremely conscious of the effect our presence has upon the environment, and we try to minimise this as much as possible. But to what degree has our presence on the planet altered environments which we have not even dared to dream of yet? ‘Wildness’ is an intrinsic draw for exploratory cavers, seeking to discover places that humanity has not thus far understood or controlled.</p>

<p>I think it would be very worthwhile if the caving community did a study to sample microplastics in the cave environment.</p>
